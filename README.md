# Card-game

This game was created as a final project requirement for an Introduction to Java Programming class.
The professor required that I create an applet and also a separate Frame for this final class assignment.
As applets are no longer supported by most browsers, I updated this project using Java FX.
It is now located in the other repository called SETGame.
